I'm a student electronic engineering, currently living in Concepcion. This blog serves as a documentation of my programming ðŸŽ’ journey. It runs on Jekyll, hosted on [github](http://github.com). I have a passion for learning new technology, although I sometimes forget that it is the very reason why I write.

If you have any questions about me or anything else, feel free to drop me a message.

Please [report](http://github.com/gadivalr/gadivalr.github.io/issues/new) any broken links or other issues you encounter.

**Thank you for visiting my blog!  âœ¨**
